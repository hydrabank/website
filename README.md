# hydrabank.systems v1

The official site of Hydrabank. A heavily modified, hard fork of [danny.works](https://www.danny.works) version 10.1. Created with React and Tailwind, based on create-react-app. 

This project contains many of the same backend components and logic as the upstream project. However, many of the visual elements and components have been modified to better suit the needs of Hydrabank and Hydralink. (It's also very elegant proof that [danny.works](https://www.danny.works) is also a versatile website template. Maybe I'll create a proper template of it in the future!)

### How to run this project
Simply `yarn start` and React's compiler will do all of its' auto-compilation magic for you! It will automatically open a page in your browser to `localhost:3000` and will automatically compile your code on file save.

To create a production-ready build, simply run `yarn build` and React will compile and roll-up all of your code into the `build/` directory.
